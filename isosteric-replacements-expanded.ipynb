DOI: [10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00290](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00290).

    "The main goal of this notebook is to show you how you can use [Python](https://www.python.org), the [RDKit chemistry toolkit](https://www.rdkit.org) and a database of isosteric replacements to apply these transformations to a molecule of your choice. In the end, you will get an enumeration - *i.e.*: a list of compounds that are the result of these isosteric replacements. \n",

    "We will be using the non-steroid antiinflammatory drug [Celecoxib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celecoxib) as an example for this exercise. \n",

    "- you have your conda installation already set up with the tools required to run this notebook. Please refer to [this guide (Code Academy)](https://www.codecademy.com/article/setting-up-jupyter-notebook) on how to install both.\n",

    "- also, make sure that the folder where this notebook is saved also contains the prepared isosteric database file `isosteric_replacement_table.csv` saved in it. This notebook will not run if that file is not present.\n",

    "> > Answer: This is probably due to the \"can't kekulize mol\" error arising from RDKit. This error happens when RDKit cannot percieve a ring as aromatic. This is normally caused by an error in how the molecule is assembled during the reaction and it may arise from an error in the SMARTS code. You could try to copy the SMILES field representing the structure and testing it into another chemical-aware service, such as the free [MarvinJS](https://marvinjs-demo.chemaxon.com/latest/), and check if Marvin can interpret and render the structure.\n",
